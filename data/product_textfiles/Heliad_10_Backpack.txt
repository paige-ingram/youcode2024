Name: Heliad 10 Backpack

Description:
Running for the train, weaving down busy sidewalks, sailing through airport security, the bike ride to work - however you go, this is the pack that keeps you moving. Streamlined and compact, it holds 10 litres of daily essentials. The main compartment hides an internal stash pocket, and an external pocket is easily accessible - and serves a stuff sack that stows your empty pack for travel. Breathable adjustable shoulder straps carry comfortably,  and the mini-ripstop fabric is light, durable, and treated for water resistance.
