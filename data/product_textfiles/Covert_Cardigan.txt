Name: Covert Cardigan

Description:
Autumn brings a chill, and you need something warm to handle its cool days and cold nights. The Covert Cardigan delivers with clean lines, advanced design, and versatile thermal performance. Made from 100% recycled polyester, the Alpenex IIâ„¢ fleece is warm, soft, constructed with wicking fibres, and has a heathered face that gives it the look of wool. Gusseted underarms provide freedom of movement, and laminated pockets secure small essentials and give the Covert its iconic aesthetic.
Size and Fit Tips: The revised Covert Cardigan has a straighter silhouette and a shorter body length for more comfortable layering.
