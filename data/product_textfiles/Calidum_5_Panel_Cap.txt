Name: Calidum 5 Panel Cap

Description:
The Calidum is a little different. We took the classic five-panel design, then made it with the same performance structured mesh we use in our Konseal climbing harness. The result's a durable, breathable cap that works anywhere â€“ pushing it on the trail, hanging out at camp, and resupplying in town. The material's stretch forms to fit, and the back secures with a TPU strap and buckle.

Short Description:
Performance five-panel hat with a classic look and comfort stretch.
