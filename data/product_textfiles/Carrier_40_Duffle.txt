Sized for shorter trips and carry-on travel, the 40L Carrier delivers serious durability and weather protection. The rugged fabric’s TPU laminate and polyurethane coating combine with sealed seams for outstanding water resistance. The wide U-shaped opening makes access easy, an internal divider organizes contents, and the white interior makes it easier to see what’s inside. Removable adjustable shoulder straps allow it to be carried as a pack, and grab handles on the ends double as lash points.
