Name: Heliad Belt 38

Description:
The 38mm Heliad is a versatile belt made from the same structured mesh used in our Konseal climbing harnesses. That means it's strong, breathable, and comfortable on adventures on and off the mountain. The low-profile separating buckle releases and secures easily and allows micro-adjustments for a perfect fit, and the captured tail design creates a clean finish and eliminates snag potential.

Belt length: S = 41.7in/1060mm, M = 45.7in/1160mm, L = 51.2in/1300mm

Short Description:
Performance 38mm belt with a low-profile separating buckle.
