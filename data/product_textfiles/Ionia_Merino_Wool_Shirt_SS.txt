Name: Ionia Merino Wool Shirt SS

Description:
The Ionia’s performance is innate. Made from Merino wool – a material known for temperature regulation and odour resistance – it’s light, soft, breathable, and responsibly sourced. The construction wraps the wool’s fine-gauge fibres around a nylon core for added durability. The fit is streamlined and comfortable, and the articulated patterning moves with you on hikes, runs, tours, and treks.
Crafted at a Fair Trade Certified facility as part of our commitment to transition 80% of Arc’teryx products to fair trade certification by 2025.
