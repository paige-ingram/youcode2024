Inspired by runners, then refined to offer the versatility to handle a wide range of high-output mountain activities, the Cormac is designed for performance, sun protection, and comfort. Its 100% recycled Phasicâ„¢ LT fabric wicks moisture, breathes, provides UPF 50+ protection, and is treated for odour resistance. The fit maximizes airflow and moves with your body, the low-profile collar layers comfortably, and the seam design minimizes friction.
