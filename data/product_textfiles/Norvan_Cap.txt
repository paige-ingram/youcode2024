Description:
The cap that completes your trail running kit. Made from a mini-ripstop stretch polyester, it's incredibly light, packable, breathable, and comfortable. The headband adjusts with a single pull for a secure fit, and reflective elements add low-light visibility. Deltaâ„¢ knit panels improve ventilation and have an odour-resistant antimicrobial finish, and a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) treatment helps minimize moisture pick-up. Our lightest, most compact hat, it wears under a helmet or hood.
